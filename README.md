# Vue Barebones

---
This is a barebones kit for spinning up a Vue project.  It consists of [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org), [Webpack Dev Server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/), and [Vue](https://vuejs.org).

With the assistance of Webpack, we spin up a dev server to serve your Vue files @ [localhost](http://localhost:8082) port 8082.  This can be changed in webpack config if you'd like to use a different port.  At present this is completely frontend.  I will be adding an Express server to run along side this for future full stack development projects.
